# Flask experiment

I like [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), but I don't like the way its documentation
seem to force you into structuring your software in a very specific and not very flexible way.

This repository contain a toy project that I'm using to experiment with Flask in less conventional
ways; it can also be copied to quickly start working on throaway projects and prototypes.
